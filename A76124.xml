            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The next morning by breake of day we made ready to fall on againe, but finding no Enemy, we then under≈øtood that they had marched away in the night about an hour after our parting with them, there we found carriages, with Ammunition and other things, &amp; the fore carriages of their Cannon, which makes us beleeve they have throwne the re≈øt of their Cannon into ≈øome pooles therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts.

And this you will partly gather by this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuing Letter which my Lord writ with his own hand to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Counte≈ø≈øe his Mother, two dayes after his Fathers death.</p>

                  <p>ON <hi>Sunday</hi> la≈øt we got the day of the Rebels, but our lo≈ø≈øe (e≈øpecially your Honours and mine) is not to be expre≈ø≈øed. For though it be a generall lo≈ø≈øe to the Kingdome, yet it toucheth us neare≈øt. But Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, Ca≈øualties in this world will happen, &amp; in ≈øuch a cau≈øe who would not have ventured both life and fortune? pray'e Madam, let this be your comfort, that it was impo≈ø≈øible for any to do braver then he did, as appeares by their owne Relation. I ≈øent a Trumpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to know what was become of my Father, hee brought me a Letter from Sir <hi>Iohn Gell</hi> and Sir <hi>VVilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Brereton,</hi> a≈ø≈øuring mee of my Fathers death, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ≈øtrange demand for his body, ≈øuch as were never before heard of in any warre, as all their Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Pri≈øoners, and Cannon which we had taken. I ≈øent them word backe, that their demands were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea≈øonable, and again≈øt the Lawes of Armes, but de≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them to give free pa≈ø≈øage to ≈øome Chirurgeons to embalme him, or to let their Chirurgeons doe it, and I would ≈øatisfy them for their paines. their la≈øt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer I have ≈øent in <hi>Philip VVilloughby's</hi> Letter which is, that they will neither ≈øend the body nor ≈øuffer our Chirurgeons to come to embalme it, but will ≈øee their owne Chirurgeons doe it. Their Relation was, that He was a≈ø≈øaulted by many together, and with

                  <p>'Pray'e Madam, be comforted, and think no man could more honourably have ended this life (fighting for his Religion, his King, and his Country) to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of heavenly joies.

Let the Reader now judge, if the <hi>genius</hi> and ≈øpirit of the Father be not eminent in the ≈øonne, and whether that hand that wrote this Letter doth not promi≈øe as great hopes for the good of this Kingdome as any whom≈øoever of his age and quality. Next you may ≈øee the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barou≈øne≈ø≈øe of the≈øe Rebels towards the Corps of the dead, who as they have made ≈øale of their Allegiance and Loyalty, ≈øo now have ≈øhaken hands with all common hone≈øty, practi≈øing tho≈øe inhumanities the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Turks</hi> ≈øcorne to de≈øcend to; For the <hi>Mahometans</hi> if they kills Commander that is an Enemy, doe not only embalme the corps, but give it ≈øafe convoy to the enemies quarters, that the freinds of the dead may give it buriall, as the noble Earle of <hi>Craford</hi> and others that have beene in the warres betwixt the <hi>Polonian</hi> and the <hi>Turke,</hi>can te≈øtify to be true. And doubtle≈ø≈øe if the <hi>Turkes</hi> knew what breach of faith given, what robbing, ≈øtripping naked, nay murther (after Armes delivered up by compo≈øition) hath beene committed on His Maje≈øties ≈øouldiers, it would further harden them again≈øt Chri≈øtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; unle≈ø≈øe they con≈øider that the≈øe things were done not as they are Chri≈øtians, but as the wor≈øt of Rebels. And let them not for ≈øhame object, that wee loo≈øe men of eminencie, but they do not, le≈øt wee tell the world the rea≈øon. For as the Commanders of the≈øe rebellious For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are made up of all Religions and Trades, ≈øo tho≈øe few men of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that are on their ≈øide, are driven by their guilt into ditches, and ≈øaw-pits, any whither out of the reach of danger, as not daring to leave the world with all their ≈øinnes about them. Therefore were it any cau≈øe under Heaven but this, that is, were not Religion, Honour, Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Lawes, Nobility, Gentry, Hone≈øty, and all at ≈øtake, the≈øe Noble Lords and Gentlemen would not make their bloud ≈øo cheape, as to ≈øpend it on ≈øuch unworthy enemies, who as they have endeavoured to murther both King and Queene, ≈øo labour the ruine of every Engli≈øh Gentleman.</p>
